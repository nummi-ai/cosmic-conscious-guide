## Common Questions About AI Meditation

### "Can AI really guide meditation effectively?"

Yes! AI can access vast knowledge about meditation techniques, adapt to your needs in real-time, and provide consistent, patient guidance. Many users find AI meditation as effective as human-guided sessions.

### "Will I become dependent on AI for meditation?"

The goal is the opposite - AI helps you develop your own practice. Over time, you'll internalize techniques and may meditate without guidance. Think of AI as training wheels, not a crutch.

### "Is AI meditation as good as in-person meditation classes?"

They serve different purposes. AI offers convenience, personalization, and 24/7 availability. In-person classes provide community and human connection. Many people benefit from both.

### "What if I've never meditated before?"

Perfect! AI meditation guides are ideal for beginners. They offer patient, personalized instruction and adapt to your learning pace without any judgment.
