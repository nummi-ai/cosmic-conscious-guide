## Common Questions About AI Astrology

### "Is AI astrology accurate?"

AI astrology is as accurate as the astrological principles it's based on. It excels at:

- ✅ Mathematical calculations (exact planetary positions)
- ✅ Pattern recognition (aspect identification)
- ✅ Data synthesis (combining multiple chart factors)

However, AI interprets archetypes - your free will determines how energies manifest.

### "Can AI predict the future?"

Astrology (AI or human) shows **potential** and **timing**, not fixed outcomes. AI companions can tell you:

- When opportunities arise
- When challenges may occur
- What energies are active
- How to work with cosmic currents

You still have free will to respond to these energies.

### "Do I need to believe in astrology for it to work?"

Not necessarily! Many people use AI astrology companions for:

- **Self-reflection tools** - Prompts for introspection
- **Timing frameworks** - Structured decision-making
- **Pattern recognition** - Understanding life cycles
- **Archetypal language** - Describing experiences

Whether you see it as cosmic truth or psychological tool, the insights can be valuable.

### "What if my birth time is unknown?"

AI can still provide:

- **Sun sign insights** - Your core identity
- **Planetary placements** - In signs (not houses)
- **Current transits** - To your planets
- **Lunar phases** - General guidance

House-based readings (Rising sign, chart angles) require exact birth time.
